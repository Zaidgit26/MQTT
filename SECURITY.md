## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate all inputs** - Client and server-side validation
3. **Use HTTPS in production** - Encrypt data in transit
4. **Regular dependency updates** - Keep packages up to date
5. **Code reviews** - Security-focused code reviews
6. **Principle of least privilege** - Minimal required permissions

### For Deployment
1. **Use strong passwords** - Minimum 12 characters with complexity
2. **Enable firewall** - Restrict unnecessary ports
3. **Regular backups** - Encrypted and tested backups
4. **Monitor logs** - Set up log monitoring and alerting
5. **SSL/TLS certificates** - Use valid certificates from trusted CAs
6. **Database security** - Enable authentication and encryption

### For Operations
1. **Regular security updates** - Keep OS and software updated
2. **Access control** - Implement proper user access management
3. **Audit logs** - Regular review of access and error logs
4. **Incident response plan** - Documented security incident procedures
5. **Penetration testing** - Regular security assessments
6. **Backup testing** - Regular restore testing

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue
Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Send a private report
Email security reports to: [security@yourcompany.com]

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix development**: Within 7 days (for critical issues)
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is deployed and tested

### 4. Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will credit you in our security advisory (if desired)
- We will not take legal action against researchers who follow this policy
